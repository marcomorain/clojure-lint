# clojure-lint A Clojure Linter For VS Code

`clojure-lint` is an extension for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that lints Clojure files.

## Features

The extension lints Clojure and EDN code using the [`clj-kondo`](https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo). Linting will happen automatically whenever a Clojure file is saved. Any problems will be overlaid on top of the source code, as well as being listed in the *Problems* pane in VS Code.

## Requirements

1. `clj-kondo` must be [installed](https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo/blob/master/doc/install.md) and available on the `PATH`.
